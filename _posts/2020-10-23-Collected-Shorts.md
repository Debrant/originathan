## 1992 to 1994
### __Reflections__ -11/92
```
In the moonlight she stands pale and tall.
Blue shadows race and glide through his mind.
Blue like her eyes that reflect midnight.
The silhouettes they cast form visions.
Eternal like mans' shadow instincts.
Shadows reflect figures long since dead.
They shine like the moonlight and reflect.
Reflecting lifetimes and love past spent.
She stands in the moonlight in dis arms.
```

### __Untitled__ -3/94
>   Time will tell what waits on the winds, and the mysteries of tomorrow will be the memories of yesterday.

### __Untitled__ -11/94

> A life without shadow and doubt is a life which does not know the beauty of of light and hope.  
## 1995 to 1996
### __Untitled__ -8/95
> Among the righteous, as among the lost, all thing can come. Ignorance and corruption as much as any.  

### __Action Junkie__-8/95

> ... and as I came to the crest and looked out upon the desert, I saw it, just like the prophet foretold. Miles long, the tear in the horizon, lanced with fingers of purple lightning.  Ozone hung black like a plague fog across the badlands. The tear was a slash of midnight in the noon sky, impossibly dark and yet somehow writhing. Violent thunder accompanies the probing tentacles of energy. And beneath, they came in file, horrible, alien and perfectly militant. A herald of destruction. There was almost no time to waste and there would be hell to follow for a long time to come. Why the fuck didn't I eat lunch?

### __Untitled__ -8/95
```
In perfect thought there is emptiness.
In perfect action there is rest.
In perfect rhythm there is silence.
In perfect chaos there is order.
```
### __Untitled__ -8/95
> In the absence of light, darkness itself takes on life.

### __Untitled__ -9/95
>   Indigo clouds part, as the knight reaches through the nightmare, and draws her into paradise.

### __Untitled__ -5/96
>   Yes, even the streets dream of their time gone past. The ghosts walk alleyways by night.



### __Untitled__ -6/96
> Life is a fickle mistress, we can at least count on our last dance, our dance with death.

## 1999 to 2000
### __Untitled__-4/99

```
I've seen your face a thousand times since you walked away.
Each time a hoax, a sham, a shattered hope.
Each time I am left with the words that need to be spoken dangling from my lips.
Each time I wonder, will we ever make peace?
Understanding is all I want now, well, that and the piece of me you took.
```

### __Untitled__-1/00
> In life, as in the garden, there are rare and beautiful blossoms that hold their fragrance (spirit) and form with grace until fading from this earth. The purpose for studying these forms is not toward recreation, for there was not, nor will there ever be another exactly like it, but rather toward enlightenment through its memory. It is through our memory of its beauty that we hope to reach its memories of self discovery.

### __The Hunt__-1/00
> My teeth are the first I notice. <br>
The crystallization of the senses ant a retardation of time. <br>
It comes in a rush from the roots of all nature, from the forest, from the primal, undeniable rage. <br>
It comes and I can only feel my teeth as they stretch and ache with the ancient memory of eyeteeth. <br>
Now only the hunter remains, the world afresh. <br>
All things sharp, clear and full of fragrance. <br>
The scent of prey lingers in the air and my tongue recalls the taste of blood. <br>
I begin to move now, changed, feeling only my teeth, I hunt.

Somewhere inside
                the key of life
passport to All
                Somehow released
from petty thoughts
                from stupidity
A new leaf turned
                to turn this key
I have to look
                I have to find
me mine and all
                To hold this truth
I must give up
                ego and want
And just let you
                be what you are
```


### __Untitled__-10/00

```
Help me ...
            time stands still
                I run forward
                but reach nothing
            I look backward
                but find I haven't moved
Yet lost ...
            I can't help
              but to look
              for the home
                  I never header
```
## 2001-2002
### __Untitled__-1/01
> Creations of myself are made, only to be cast aside. Revised again, I'm made anew through the magic of pretty lies.

### __Thanksgiving__ '03
> The sky is always like mercury as I lay my head down to sleep. The early morning sun I try to shut out eventually cons its way into  my room. On that threshold of consciousness, a solar hand soothes my skin and warms my hair like a cosmic mother. I drift across worlds and time, free from humanity and all its gilded cages. Free to roam, to change, to think, knowing that my mother waits to brightly show me the way home. Everyday I am roused by the soft light of high noon streaming through the cracks between the sill and curtain. I awaken more free and poised somewhere between wonder and pain. I have to coax the pain away, reassuring it that it can welcome me again tomorrow and perhaps stay a little longer. Moving now comes easy, as is should for any robot. I hide my secrets from the others though, for an automaton can't be self satisfied. Even though the corners of my armor is tattered and revealing originality, my peers do not, or pretend not, to notice. I know some see through, but I have no time to lead. Whenever I close my eyes to gather energy, my mind's eye looks back on my life and draws from it the splendor of the beauty that has blessed my life. Now as true energy is circulated between cosmos and self, I create momentum. My own energy carries me further with each breath. The only danger, the system of command that encourages defeat and promotes fatigue. This is why I treasure my memories and reject associations not founded in truth or beauty. To each of my beautiful memories, you give me strength. Thank you.
