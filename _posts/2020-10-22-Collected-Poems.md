### __Angels__ -v1 1994
```
The angels watch
                    as ravens fly
to empty field
                    the field
my heart
                    dark birds
my friends
                    we lost fellows
the angels watch
                    as we
whisper dreams
        disguise hope
                shout at fear
                        as we mourn the lost
the angels watch
                    as dark birds fly
my fellows gone
                    from empty field
the field my heart
                    I mourn the lost
the angels watch
```
### __The Dream__-8/95
```
Bound by hand
  Bathed in a sphere of flame
Trapped Weightless
  Held suspended
In audience of the holy
  perfect beauty this goddess
In fire she dwells
  No cloth can touch her perfection
As she speaks to me
  Fiery hair cast out
In a halo of curls
  I am wrong, have been in error
She tells me secrets of womanhood
  Shows me truth in tenderness
I cannot see her holy light
  but it sears my soul all the same
She offers her perfection
  I must decline from future ruin
She smiles as I kiss her hand
  You have learned, she says
I wake to the memory of her smile
    I smile back at the goddess watching
```
### __Crooked Moon__ -5/96
```
The well worn moon hangs crooked in the smoky sky.
It's brackish light cast out is lost in midnight of my eyes.
Through empty streets of darkness I search but do not find.
Of all the things gained by my light, it is to the darkness that I bind.
In this murky town of heat and night, beauty is lost to rot in crime.
If there is darkness that can save beauty, than it effort, I waste no time.
Now a gray-green smoke drifts loosely down these empty cobbled streets.
The moon and I smile crookedly and cast out on into the darkened heat.
```


### __Inside Man__ -8/96
> Deep inside <br>
  Nation of fear <br>
  Generations of deceit <br>
  Lies coiled serpent <br>
  Rivers of hate <br>
  Deep inside <br>
  Ignorance is fear<br>
  Government of deceit <br>
  Young man serpent <br>
  Raised on hate <br>
  Deep inside <br>
  Raging with fear <br>
  Fueled by deceit <br>
  Violent little serpent <br>
  Chokes on hate <br>
  Deep inside <br>
### __Angels__ -v2 1998
```
            The angels watch
            as ravens fly
            to empty field
          the field   my heart
    Dark birds            my friends
    Wayward                  fellows
            The angels watch
                  As we
          whisper       dreams
          disguise        hope
          shout        at fear
          mourn       the lost
            The angels watch
            as dark birds fly
            my fellows gone
            from empty field
          the field   my heart
            I mourn the lost
            The angels watch
```
### __Books__-1/01

> forced words on white sheets <br>
troubled thoughts and lovers meet <br>
in alleyways and colonnades <br>
dancing words turned shifting maze <br>
unseeable without the pen <br>
torn and tattered are become the thoughts of men



### __Untitled__-1/02
> A ring of darkness fades from sight <br>
colors blended turn to fight <br>
made strong again by returning light

### __Chance__-8/04

> a look my life has searched for <br>
> a breathlessness in the hunger of the eyes <br>
> heart and lungs with bitter hope <br>
> happy-sad irony, this moment together <br>
> what sacrifice could be too great to grant <br>
> the courage to make this moment least <br>
> but we continue on, passing by <br>
> invigorated with this seed of hope  <br>
> to slowly forget the magic that did not grow

### __Monster__-8/04

> Pent up monster <br>
Little minded demon <br>
Blackened shriveled heart <br>
Pounding maniacally <br>
Heroically crests the summit <br>
to throw itself into despair
